# Reusable Components Playground

A modern React components playground showcasing reusable, accessible, and type-safe UI components. This project serves as a testbed for building high-quality React components using best practices and modern tooling.

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Development

Components are built with TypeScript and follow modern React patterns. Each component is designed to be:

-   Reusable and composable
-   Fully typed with TypeScript
-   Customizable through variants
