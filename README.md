# Reusable Components Playground

A modern React components playground showcasing reusable, accessible, and type-safe UI components. This project is a playground for the article on [aboutjs.dev](https://www.aboutjs.dev/en) about [reusable UI components in React](https://www.aboutjs.dev/en/posts/creating-reusable-ui-components-in-react-write-once-use-everywhere).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Development

Components are built with TypeScript and follow modern React patterns. Each component is designed to be:

-   Reusable and composable
-   Fully typed with TypeScript
-   Customizable through variants
-   Styled using TailwindCSS utility classes
